The final build product may be artifacts pushed to a git repository or a docker container pushed to a container registry.\\n\\nWhen these should be deployed on an app server, the pipeline should include a _deploy_ step, which represents the \\"CD\\" in CI/CD - the automatic deployment of a pipeline\'s final product.\\n\\nThere are various ways to accomplish CD with Woodpecker, depending on your project\'s specific needs.\\n\\n## Invoking deploy script via SSH\\n\\nThe final step in your pipeline could SSH into the app server and run a deployment script.\\n\\nOne of the benefits would be that the deployment script\'s output could be included in the pipeline\'s log. However in general, this is a complicated option as it tightly couples the CI and app servers.\\n\\nAn SSH step could be written by using a plugin, like [ssh](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/ssh) or [git push](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/Git%20Push).\\n\\n## Polling for asset changes\\n\\nThis option completely decouples the CI and app servers, and there is no explicit deploy step in the pipeline.\\n\\nOn the app server, one should create a script or cron job that polls for asset changes (every minute, say). When a new version is detected, the script redeploys the app.\\n\\nThis option is easy to maintain, but the downside is a short delay (one minute) before new assets are detected.\\n\\n## Using a configuration management tool\\n\\nIf you are using a configuration management tool (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet), then you could setup the last pipeline step to call that tool to perform the redeployment.\\n\\nA plugin for [Ansible](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/Ansible) exists and could be adapted accordingly.\\n\\nThis option is complex and only suitable in an environment in which you\'re already using configuration management.\\n\\n## Using webhooks (recommended)\\n\\nIf your forge (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.) supports webhooks, then you could create a separate listening app that receives a webhook when new assets are available and redeploys your app.\\n\\nThe listening \\"app\\" can be something as simple as a PHP script.\\n\\nAlternatively, there are a number of popular webhook servers that simplify this process, so you only need to write your actual deployment script. For example, [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) and [webhookd](https://github.com/ncarlier/webhookd).\\n\\nThis is arguably the simplest and most maintainable solution."},{"id":"hello-cookbook","metadata":{"permalink":"/cookbook/hello-cookbook","source":"@site/cookbook/2023-12-23-hello-cookbook/index.md","title":"Welcome to Woodpecker\'s cookbook blog","description":"Here, we\'ll publish various guides and tutorials.","date":"2023-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 23, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.135,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"qwerty287","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/qwerty287","image_url":"https://github.com/qwerty287.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/qwerty287.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome to Woodpecker\'s cookbook blog","description":"Here, we\'ll publish various guides and tutorials.","slug":"hello-cookbook","authors":[{"name":"qwerty287","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/qwerty287","image_url":"https://github.com/qwerty287.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/qwerty287.png"}],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Continuous Deployment","permalink":"/cookbook/continuous-deployment"}},"content":"Welcome to this cookbook blog.
